# BAR CART

## Overview:

Be your own bartender! With BAR CART, you can find inspiration to create a signature cocktail with an ingredient you already have on hand. Our application lets users search for cocktails by ingredients, and if you find some you love, you can favorite them for later. This application was a final showcase project from the Mod 3 curriculum at Turing School of Software & Design that was completed over the duration of six days.

## Application in Action:

Choose an Ingredient from our list

Click on a cocktail to see more details, including the recipe

Add cocktails to your favorite recipes and view them in the favorites page

## Set Up:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- `cd` into the application.
- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to see the application.
  - Paste http://localhost:3000/ into your browser to view.
  - If you need to stop running the application, run `Control + C`.
- To view tests, run `npm run cypress`.

## Goals and Challenges:

- Showcased knowledge of React, Router, asynchronous Javascript, end to end testing with Cypress, and responsive CSS design.
- This was my first time using PropTypes, which I have found to be a helpful developer tool.
- Finding a suitable existing API for this project was a challenging first step. I considered making my own API, but did not because of the tight time constraints for this project.

## Technologies:

- React
- Router
- Javascript
- CSS
- JSX/HTML
- Cypress
- Restful APIs
- PropTypes

## Future Additions:

- User ability to remove a cocktail from favorites list
- Implement SCSS styling
